      <p>	Since 1998, UC Berkeley has offered admissions, on average, to 12,687 incoming freshmen students. However, from the 1990’s to present, the number of applicants has increased three-fold. The growing disparity between the volume of applicants and the number admitted students has dropped UC Berkeley’s acceptance rate over a percentage point each year: in 1996, the incoming freshman class at UC Berkeley had a 45% chance of admission; in 2019, they had a 17% chance. Put another way, in 1996, any given student was competing with over 31,000 other applicants—no small feat of its own. Fast-forwarding to 2019, any single student was competing with over 106,000 other applicants (see graph).</p>
      <p>Although the number of applicants has significantly increased over the decades, the number of students admitted to UC Berkeley has remained relatively constant. Overlaid is the acceptance rate per year (not drawn to scale).</p>

      <p>With this drastic increase in competition, UC Berkeley’s standards for admitted students have shot up—test scores, GPAs, personal statements and extracurricular activities all play major roles in the admissions process. But, as any high school student applying to college can attest, achieving the level of excellence needed to compete with thousands of other students in all of these areas is time-consuming and difficult. Consequently, it has become common practice for many students to hire tutors, college counselors and coaches to help them get into their dream school. But this begs the question: are colleges admitting a student or a student’s checkbook?</p>
      <p>This issue has become increasingly relevant as the competition for higher education has grown  across the nation. According to a USA Today poll from 2019, “fewer than one in five Americans believe the college admissions process is ‘generally fair’” and an additional “67 percent of respondents said that the current college application and admissions process ‘favors the rich and powerful.’” High School students across the country have voiced their concerns about colleges championing wealthier students because of their access to exclusive entities such as private tutors, schools and counselors.</p>
      <p>UC Berkeley is no exception. On September 22, 2020 the California State Auditor released a report that revealed oversights in UC Berkeley’s admissions process. Over the period of 2013-14, the audit found that UC Berkeley was responsible for falsely admitting 55 students: 17 students were falsely admitted due to a donor connection, 11 were falsely admitted due to a staff connection, and 14 students were waitlisted because of either a donor or staff connection.</p>
      <p>According to a NPR source, “One [false admit] had babysat for a colleague of the former director of undergraduate admissions. One had a family member who was a friend of a regent. Another was the child of a major donor. One applicant's family promised a large donation. All of them were admitted.”</p>
      <p> The audit also found that 13 students were admitted due to an athletic waiver. The campus athletics admissions process reviews applicants on much different qualifications than the general applicant pool. These different considerations allow students that may not be academically competitive in the regular admissions process to have a better chance of acceptance. The lack of staff oversight and verification of athletic ability has allowed staff to falsify students’ athletic abilities.</p>
      <p> The majority of these inappropriate admissions occurred due to missing safeguards needed to prevent a single individual from being able to make a unilateral admission decision or validate key information about an applicant. Gaps in oversight allowed staff members with connections or those responsible for donor relations to influence admissions.</p>

      <p>During the years 2013-14 the California State Auditor found 55 UC Berkeley students were falsely admitted. The highest number of students falsely admitted were due to donor connections.</p>
      <p>In March 2019 the University of California conducted a UC systemwide internal audit. In a response to the audit, President of the UC System Michael V. Drake explained that, similar to the California State Audit, the internal audit revealed that the admissions processes related to athletic recruits and to admission by exception were vulnerable to improper conduct. These findings resulted in UC Berkeley and other UC campuses taking action to safeguard their admissions process, especially their athletics admissions processes.</p>
      <p>However, the California State Auditor, Elaine Howle, responded that they believe the UC System did not make sufficient changes to safeguard their admissions process. Pointing specifically to UC Berkeley, Howle concludes that, “Although both audits addressed the potential for inappropriate influence in the admissions process, as we state earlier in the report, the university’s audit did not detect the ways in which staff from the development office [donor relations] and other university staff inappropriately influenced admissions decisions at UC Berkeley.”</p>
      <p>The California State Auditor advised that staff from the development office should not be able to discuss applicants with admissions officers. Furthermore, Howle recommends that regular UC systemwide audits are conducted annually to ensure accountability. She argues that, “[left] unaddressed, these issues will continue to harm qualified applicants who apply to the university.”</p>
      <p>UC Berkeley’s failure to sufficiently comply with the recommendations proposed by the audit perpetuate gaps in the system that can be taken advantage of—oftentimes by those with more connections, power, and/or wealth. The audit notes that “the majority of these [falsely admitted] applicants were white and at least half had an annual family income of $150,000 or more.”</p>
      <p>The anxieties of students competing to get into college have been exacerbated by the fact that the majority of people utilizing these connections to get a leg up on their competition are of Caucasian descent and within the highest income bracket. But, despite this correlation, California voters recently shot down Proposition 16, which would reinstate the foundations of affirmative action (as initially repealed by Proposition 209 in 1996). In the failure of Prop. 16, colleges and universities around the country are once again forced to use a color and gender-blind admissions process. </p>
      <p>However, in spite of Prop. 16’s failure, UC Berkeley has taken steps to support a more fair admissions process, equipped with new assistant vice chancellor and director of undergraduate admissions Femi Ogundele, who believes “diversity should be at the center of an institution’s mission, not something that is additive or adjunct” (Berkeley News). </p>
      <h4> Bubble chart here </h4>
      <p>In the most recent year, UC Berkeley admitted the highest percentage of students from underrepresented populations such as first-generation students, households that make less than $25,000 a year and minority-race students. </p>
      <p>With Ogundele’s expertise, UC Berkeley has admitted the most ethnically diverse class in over 30 years. In a Berkeley News article, Ogundele notes that one of the biggest changes to this academic cycle was taking more contextual information about the applicants into consideration. Admissions readers were provided with more background regarding the highschools and neighborhoods from which the students were applying. Ogundele believes that, “Now...these admissions officers are in a better position to understand what the student applicants have accomplished in life, and in what context.”</p>
      <p>Ogundele also attributed the increase in diversity to marketing tactics: UC Berkeley has recently increased emphasis on reaching out to rural and low socioeconomic areas. This strategy has allowed UC Berkeley to build and solidify relationships with high school counselors in under-privileged areas, encouraging more students in these areas to apply to UC Berkeley. Ogundele has stated that he is “a big believer that, when it comes to diversity and excellence, you can’t have one without the other. You can’t have an excellent student body without it being diverse.”</p>
